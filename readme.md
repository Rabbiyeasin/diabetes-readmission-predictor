## 🏥 Project Context

HealthFirst Medical Network, a 130-hospital system, was losing $2.1M annually 
in Medicare penalties due to a 22% diabetes readmission rate—nearly double 
the 12% industry benchmark. With no systematic risk assessment process, 
clinical staff were making discharge decisions based on intuition, resulting 
in 15-20 preventable readmissions monthly.

I was engaged as a data science consultant to build a predictive system that 
would identify high-risk patients before discharge and integrate seamlessly 
into clinical workflows.
