# CLIENT FEEDBACK - DAY 1

**FROM:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Medical Officer  
**TO:** [Your Name]  
**DATE:** December 2, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** RE: Day 1 Deliverable - IMPRESSED

---

**Excellent work.**

Your Day 1 analysis just validated what I've been telling our board for months—we have a **data problem, not a staffing problem**.

Three things stood out:

1. **The A1C >8 finding is gold.** This gives us a single, measurable biomarker to flag at-risk patients. I'm presenting this to our Endocrinology department next week.

2. **The 5% ultra-high utilizers data is exactly what our CFO needed to hear.** We're burning resources on reactive care for this cohort. Your numbers prove we need proactive care coordination.

3. **The specialty risk gap is eye-opening.** I had no idea our surgical departments had such higher readmission rates. This will trigger a complete review of our post-surgical discharge protocols.

**For Day 2, I need you to:**
- Define the exact prediction target (what does "readmission" mean—30 days? Same diagnosis?)
- Start building features that capture medication complexity (poly-pharmacy risk)
- Show me correlation heatmaps—which variables actually predict readmissions?

Our board meeting is in 8 days. Keep delivering insights like this, and I'll make sure they see your work.
