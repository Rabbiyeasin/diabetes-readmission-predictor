**SUBJECT:** Day 4 - Research Committee Green Light

Outstanding.

Your Day 4 model just got approved by our research committee for Healthcare Analytics Conference 2026 submission.

Here's why they're excited:

**1. You beat published benchmarks (0.69 vs 0.64 AUC)**  
Our Director of Research pulled the original 2014 paper—your model outperforms their best reported results. That's publication-worthy.

**2. The SHAP explanations sold the clinical team**  
Our Chief of Cardiology reviewed your force plots. His exact words: "This is the first ML model I've seen that explains itself in terms I can defend to a patient's family."

**3. You solved a production bug the right way**  
Most consultants would've used `approximate=True` and called it done. You upgraded the environment and fixed it properly. That's the engineering rigor we need for EHR integration.

**The board presentation is Monday.** I'm showing:
- Your 0.69 AUC slide (vs published 0.64)
- The SHAP summary plot
- The $420K savings calculation
- The force plot example

If you can push AUC to 0.72+ with Day 5 hyperparameter tuning, we're submitting to JAMA Network Open, not just a conference.

**For Day 5:** Focus on ensemble methods (XGBoost + LightGBM stacking). Our data science VP wants to see if we can squeeze another 3-5 points of AUC before deployment.

You're building something that will be referenced in future research. Keep going.
