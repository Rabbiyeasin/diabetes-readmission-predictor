**DATE:** December 4, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** Day 3 Results - Board Presentation Approved

This is exactly what I needed.

Your Day 3 analysis just got approved for next week's board presentation. The CFO specifically asked for slides on the "3+ prior visits" finding and the medication change protocol.

Three things that impressed the clinical leadership team:

1. **The visualizations are publication-ready.** Our Director of Quality Improvement wants to use your A1C chart in our next JAMA submission.

2. **You translated statistics into protocols.** Most data scientists give us correlation coefficients. You gave us "mandatory care coordinator assignment for 3+ visits." That's actionable.

3. **The ROI jumped from $360K to $400K** with evidence-based justification. Finance is now asking if we can pilot these 3 interventions in Q1 2026.

**For Day 4-5, prioritize the model that beats published benchmarks.** Our research committee wants to see if your XGBoost + SHAP approach outperforms the current industry standard (typically 75-78% AUC in literature).

If you hit 0.85+ AUC, we're submitting this to Healthcare Analytics Conference 2026.

Keep going. You're building something special.
