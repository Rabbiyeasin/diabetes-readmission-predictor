# PROJECT KICKOFF EMAIL

**FROM:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Medical Officer  
**TO:** [Your Name], Senior Data Science Consultant  
**DATE:** December 2, 2025  
**SUBJECT:** 🚨 URGENT: Diabetes Readmission Crisis - Need Data-Driven Solution

---

Good morning,

I'm reaching out because **we have a critical problem** that's costing our hospital network millions of dollars annually, and I need your expertise to solve it.

## 📊 THE PROBLEM:

Our hospital network (HealthFirst Medical - 130+ facilities across the US) is facing **catastrophic financial penalties** from Medicare due to excessive diabetes patient readmissions. Here are the hard numbers:

- **Current 30-day readmission rate:** 22% (Industry benchmark: 12%)
- **Annual Medicare penalties:** $2.1 Million
- **Average cost per readmission:** $15,000
- **Patient volume:** 8,500+ diabetic patients annually

**What's worse:** Our clinical staff has NO systematic way to identify which patients are at highest risk before discharge. They're making gut-feel decisions, and patients are falling through the cracks.

## 💔 THE HUMAN COST:

Last month, we discharged a 68-year-old diabetic patient named Margaret. She seemed stable. Three weeks later, she was back in our ER with severe complications - could have been prevented if we'd flagged her as high-risk and scheduled follow-up care.

**This happens 15-20 times per month.**

## 🎯 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

I need you to build an **end-to-end predictive system** that:

1. **Identifies high-risk patients** BEFORE discharge (so we can intervene)
2. **Explains WHY** each patient is high-risk (clinicians won't trust a black box)
3. **Integrates into clinical workflow** (our doctors are overwhelmed - needs to be dead simple)

## 📁 WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH:

I'm giving you access to our **historical patient database:**
- **101,766 patient records** from 130 US hospitals (1999-2008)
- **50+ features** including: demographics, diagnoses, medications, lab results, prior visits, discharge status
- **De-identified data** (fully compliant with HIPAA)

## 🎯 YOUR DELIVERABLES (10-Day Sprint):

**Phase 1 (Days 1-2):** Data Assessment & Initial Insights  
- Load the data into a queryable database
- Run diagnostic SQL queries to understand our patient population
- **Deliverable:** Executive summary of data quality and key patterns

**Phase 2 (Days 3-4):** Deep Analysis & Target Definition  
- Identify what drives readmissions in our population
- Create the prediction target (30-day readmission flag)
- **Deliverable:** Insights presentation with visualizations

**Phase 3 (Days 5-7):** Build Predictive Model  
- Engineer features that capture clinical risk
- Train and validate machine learning models
- **Deliverable:** Model with 75%+ accuracy and explainability

**Phase 4 (Days 8-10):** Clinical Decision Support Tool  
- Build an interactive chatbot for clinicians
- Deploy it so doctors can get risk scores in real-time
- **Deliverable:** Live web application with demo

## 💰 SUCCESS METRICS:

If we can reduce our readmission rate from 22% to 15% (industry average), we'll:
- **Save $360,000** in Medicare penalties annually
- **Prevent ~600 readmissions** per year
- **Improve patient outcomes** (fewer complications, better quality of life)

## ⏰ URGENCY:

Medicare's next review period starts January 15, 2026. We need to show progress on readmission reduction strategies by then, or we face **increased penalties** in the next fiscal year.

## 🤝 YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT (Day 1):

**Start today.** I need you to:

1. Set up the project infrastructure (GitHub repo, database)
2. Load our historical patient data into a SQL database
3. Run **7 critical diagnostic queries** I need answers to by end of day:
   - How many patients do we have per medical condition?
   - What's our actual readmission rate in the data?
   - Which age groups have highest readmission risk?
   - What's the distribution of time in hospital?
   - How many patients are on multiple medications?
   - Which diagnoses are most common in readmitted patients?
   - Are there seasonal patterns in readmissions?

**I need a brief written summary of findings by EOD.**

Our hospital board is watching this project closely. Deliver strong results, and this could expand to our entire 130-hospital network.

Looking forward to your insights,
